This project demonstrates an efficient method for programming and updating an ESP32 device with a damaged USB interface by using another ESP32 as a UART bridge and implementing Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware updates through GitHub. A secondary ESP32 board with a functional USB port was configured as a USB-to-UART serial bridge using a lightweight forwarding firmware. This bridge enabled flashing the initial bootloader program into the broken ESP32 using esptool and standard UART signals (TX, RX, GND, BOOT, and EN).

The initial bootloader firmware was designed to connect automatically to a predefined Wi-Fi network and fetch the latest firmware binary (firmware.bin) hosted on a GitHub repository. Upon successful download, the bootloader flashed the new image into the ESP32's internal memory using the OTA Update API and rebooted the device to execute the updated application. Subsequent firmware modifications are uploaded directly to GitHub, and the ESP32 retrieves them during each reset, eliminating the need for physical re-programming and making the system fully updatable remotely.

This method ensures reliable firmware deployment even when USB hardware is damaged and provides a scalable, cloud-based approach for continuous firmware management using GitHub as the OTA source. The solution demonstrates a practical, cost-effective pathway for embedded OTA updates, remote maintenance, and recovery of ESP32 boards with non-functional USB interfaces.
